## Step 0.1 (size M), 2026-10-13: Phase 0 documents
**Works:** 11 documents written. No code.
**Stubbed:** nothing.
**Tests:** 0 (none apply).
**Not verified:** the ZIP app was never installed, built or run by us. Package versions in D-13 are lookups only.

### Found along the way (from reading the ZIP)
1. The ZIP is React/Vite with localStorage. The PDF assumes Next.js, Prisma and an existing SMS integration. Neither the stack nor the SMS code exists.
2. Seed data: member `m2` has a ₦4,000 "Loan Repaid" payment but no loan exists for `m2`.
3. Auto-Inactive runs in a UI effect, not in an atomic transaction. Balances are clamped at zero, which can hide negative values.
4. The pay-off button is hidden (not disabled with a reason) when the member has an active loan or zero balance.
5. "Today" is taken from the UTC date, not Lagos time.
6. Payment and loan dropdowns list only members the user created (the visibility filter applies to members).
7. Passwords are plaintext in localStorage. The default login is printed on the login screen and in the README.
8. Money uses JavaScript numbers with a 0.01 tolerance.
9. All dependencies in the ZIP use `latest`. No tests, no lint, no check script.
10. `PRODUCTION_SCHEMA_AND_API.md` uses `Decimal` money and has no users, actors or audit.
11. npm: Prisma CLI `latest` is a release candidate (8.0.0-rc.22); the client `latest` is 7.10.0. We chose the 7.10.0 pair.
12. The first `npm view typescript version` call returned only a notice. A second call gave 7.0.2.
